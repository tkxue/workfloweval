1. All code I wrote is AGPL.

2. There is code here I copied from other libs/demos/examples which testing things out.
   Those copied code belongs to their own license (mostly Apache/MIT/BSD),
   but I need to formally separate things out / correctly labeled them.

3. This applies to (but limited to) all the egui code I copied/pasted.
